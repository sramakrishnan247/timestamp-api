## API Basejump: Timestamp Microservice
By S Ramakrishnan

For [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com) - [API Basejump: Timestamp Microservice](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/basejump-timestamp-microservice)

### User Stories

1. I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
2. If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
3. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
